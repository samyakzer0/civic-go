### 5. Notification Template Utils

## Firebase Integration

The Firebase integration is set up to handle:
- Push notification permission requests
- FCM token generation and storage
- Foreground message handling
- Background notification support

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Notification Center Access**:
   - Bell icon in the header now opens the enhanced notification center
   - Real-time updates of unread notification count

2. **Notification Preferences**:
   - Accessible from user profile
   - Fine-grained control over notification types
   - Do Not Disturb mode for quiet hours

3. **Notification History**:
   - Complete history of all notifications
   - Filtering options for better organization
   - Clear visual indicators for different notification types

## Implementation Notes

1. **Offline Support**: 
   - The system falls back to localStorage if Supabase is unavailable
   - Ensures notifications are still delivered even when offline

2. **Multiple Channels**:
   - In-app notifications always available
   - Push notifications for users who grant permission
   - Email notifications as an additional option

3. **User Preferences**:
   - All notification settings respect user preferences
   - Do Not Disturb hours prevent notifications during specific times
   - Type-specific toggles for granular control

## Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics**: Track notification engagement rates
2. **Scheduled Notifications**: Allow notifications to be scheduled in advance
3. **Group Notifications**: Consolidate multiple similar notifications
4. **Rich Media**: Support for images and action buttons in notifications
5. **Custom Sound**: Allow users to select custom notification sounds

## Integration into App

1. The notification system is integrated into:
   - HomePage (NotificationCenter in header)
   - ProfilePage (link to notification preferences)
   - App.tsx (initialization and routing)

2. The NotificationIcon component now uses the enhanced NotificationCenter
